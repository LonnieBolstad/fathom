# Fathom: Your AI Expert Unleashed

## 1. Executive Summary

Fathom tackles users' tasks like a PhD with power tools. Fathom reimagines AI-assisted creation through our **Text-to-Product Engine™**, combining multi-layer autonomous research with code synthesis. Unlike single-pass LLMs, our system implements chain-of-validation reasoning and fractal task decomposition to deliver production-ready solutions.

## 2. Use Cases

1. **Deep Research**: Fathom helps you study a topic deeply, like a student working on a big school project. It splits your question into small parts, finds answers step by step, and makes a clear report you can update.
2. **Data Analysis**: Fathom gathers relevant data from the internet, performs multi-step reasoning and analysis, and generates a comprehensive visual report.
3. **Travel Planning**: Fathom helps you plan a trip by finding places to go, checking prices, making a schedule with maps, and letting you share it online.
4. **Education**: Fathom helps you create a study plan based on a book topic using lessons, quizzes, and fun activities.

## 3. System Design

## 4. Module Explanation

### AI Agents

Fathom involves multiple AI agents with multiple rounds of research to solve the user's tasks.

**Query Rephrasing Agent**

- Implements chain-of-density prompting to transform vague requests into research-optimized queries  
- Example: "Why Tesla stock reached 2 trillion last month" → "Generate Research on the reason for Tesla stock soaring to 1 trillion between 11/01/2024 - 12/01/2024"
  - Fact-checking: correct "2 trillion" to "1 trillion" by looking up on internet
  - Semantic Expansion: expand the question by its semantic meaning 
  - Date correction: replace "last month" with "11/01/2024 - 12/01/2024" to get a more accurate result
  - ...

**Intention Classification Agent**

Identified Dimensions:
- Primary: Financial Analysis (87% confidence)  
- Secondary: Market Sentiment Tracking (72%)  
- Tertiary: Investment Risk Assessment (65%)

Output:
```json
{
  "domain": "Finance",
  "output_type": "Analytical Report",
  "compliance": "SEC Regulation Fair Disclosure",
  "sources_required": 5
}
```

**PhD Topic Choosing Agent**

- Main Topic Picker: Leverages data from the internet to identify the main topic of the user's question.
- Sub Topic Picker: Leverages data and previous topics generated by our AI Agents to generate a new sub-topic
  - Depth-First Generation: Pick a topic from the previous topic set and generate a deeper topic
  - Breadth-First Generation: Pick and generate a topic that has not been generated previously
  
**PhD Topic Solving Agent**

Leverages data from the internet to solve a certain topic, come out with a summary

**System Design Agent**

- Leverages data from the internet and questions from users, come out with a system architecture that follows best-practice
- List down the sub modules that are going to be created

**Coding Agent**

Generate code for a sub-module according to the question and system design provided by System Design Agent.

**Code Review Agent**

Review the code from the Coding Agent and provide an update on the problematic code.
